# _HELP_

### Concept
_HELP_ is a series of character-driven vignettes following the day-to-day experiences of tech support workers. Each vignette gives insight to what goes on behind the scenes for those who keep people up and running. Readers will learn about the tasks and techniques tech support workers employ to serve their customer bases. Alongside the more light technical side, the stories in _HELP_ will introduce readers to a cast of colorful characters, whose personalities will be key to the flavor of this series.
