# _HELP_

### Concept
_HELP_ is a series of character-driven vignettes following the day-to-day experiences of tech support workers. Each vignette gives insight to what goes on behind the scenes for those who keep people up and running. Readers will learn about the tasks and techniques tech support workers employ to serve their customer bases. Alongside the more light technical side, the stories in _HELP_ will introduce readers to a cast of colorful characters, whose personalities will be key to the flavor of this series.
### Characters
- **Robert "Marv" George** - A fairly easy-going man in his early 40s. Master of small talk. Not the most technically minded, but fully capable at getting the job done. Has worked in tech support for a about a decade and a half, and is the most senior member of the Help Desk, but his experience often does more to show his age than expertise. Is considered to be a kind of a team lead through tenure alone. Gets along well with others, is quite charismatic, but becomes very short tempered when frustrated. 
- **Isaiah Allebach** - One of the most technical members of the help desk. Early 20s. Formerly Amish, he left his community after gaining an interest in all things technology during rumspringa, eventually pursuing a career in IT. He is a habitual tinkerer and often leads the team to finding new solutions to issues that pop up. He is very outgoing and has an eccentric personality.
- **Clint Freiling** - The Network Operator on the Help Desk, tasked with monitoring all production systems and coordinating relevant team members when things go down. Former military in his late 40s. Brash and playful, but deadly serious at times. Enjoys playing the role of mentor, though his rough-around-the-edges personality means most don't take his advice seriously. Somewhat of an 'older brother' figure to the rest of the Help Desk staff.
- **Kieran Watts** - The youngest member of the team. More knowledgeable about IT systems than anyone else on the team. A prankster. Enjoys meddling with other members' systems. Lacks confidence as a result of his inexperience, and is quite introverted most of the time. He is both feared and respected by the rest of the team for his expertise, but his impish ways often make him seen as more pest than presence. 
- **Matt Smith** - Newest member of the team. Late 20s. Jokey and relateable. Has technical history through computer enthusiast hobbies, but is entry level in his professional IT carreer. Self-proclaimed as 'normal' and cannot help but see the oddities of his team members. Functionally serves as the bridge between the reader and the fiction, learning the ropes alongside the reader.
